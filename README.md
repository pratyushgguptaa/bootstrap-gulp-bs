# Bootstrap Build Setup with Gulp + BrowserSync

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/seshaljain/bootstrap-gulp-bs.git
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Make sure you've `gulp` installed globally. If not, head over to 
https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start first to install gulp. 

Run the build chain:

```sh
gulp
```

Head over to `http://localhost:3000` to see your project with live-reloading support. No more refreshing manually! :tada:  
You can also access the server on your phone (or any device on the same network) via the External URL provided in the running terminal or on the BS dashboard at `http://localhost:3001`
